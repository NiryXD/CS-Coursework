Short Summary of what I did:
I tried recreating the Blender donut tutorial to get the basics, so that I can create a game model in the future. Other than that, I implemented code for movement to another group member's animation. As well as refined the UI to be more on theme. That includes chaining scenes, new backgrounds, and music.
