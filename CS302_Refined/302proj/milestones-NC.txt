March 31, 2025, ~12:00 pm - ~3:00 pm:
I drew some enemy sprites and coded the enemy get hitback 
from the punches that the main character (Emrich) was throwin down. 
Was still trying to understand how to use Unity in the way I want it to 
without a tutorial. The code I made is hitScript.cs in this repo in the
assets, as well as the enemy sprites. Also finishing up this file (~3 hours)

Total time (including lab): ~6 hours

Short Report:
I want to say that I am thankful for this project because I've always wanted
to try and use Unity, but it seemed to hard to start for me. This was a reason
to start and I have my groupmates to help when needed. I think everything is 
going fine and should be good to go.
