# RNGapp

I created an iOS app that, upon the user clicking the blue 'Generate' button, generates a random number between 1 and 100. 
This uses react native and the Expo Go app on a phone. I cloned the repository in the terminal and opened the “RNGapp” React Directory. 
To keep things up to date with the rest of the group and avoid overwriting anyone else's changes, we’ll need to run “npm install” to download all the necessary files, much like running “git pull”. 
Then, to run the app on the user’s phone, I had to run the “npx Expo Start –tunnel” command. 
This gives the user a QR code that, when scanned, opens the Expo Go app on their phone. They can then fully run their newly created app.
