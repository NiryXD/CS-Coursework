## Screen Color Changer (Expo React Native)
Built an Expo React Native app that changes the entire screen color each time you press a button. The current color’s hex code is shown on screen, and there’s a Reset button to return to white. My group is trying to create a mobile app, so using React is one step of the process. Since we all do not have Macs, we decided not to go with Xcode.
