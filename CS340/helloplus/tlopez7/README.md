I made a quick app that displays the text "Hello World!" and also 
has a counter that the user is able to press a button an infinite 
amount of times. In order to run the app, you need to install "Expo Go" 
off the app store first. You then go ahead and clone the repo inside the terminal
and open the "HelloWorldApp" React Directory in my NetID folder. Once in you first want to run "npm install" to
download all the required files. If needed, you should download any others needed. Once done just run
the command "npx expo start --tunnel" and it will prompt the user to scan a QR code. If there is an issued with
installing expo run the comman 'npm install --save-dev @expo/ngrok'. This will work as a backup. Finally,
once the user scans the QR code the app will open inside of "Expo Go". We plan to use React and 
Expo Go for our live demo.

Note: When inside the app, adjust your phone brightness in order to make the "Hello World!"
statement clear.
