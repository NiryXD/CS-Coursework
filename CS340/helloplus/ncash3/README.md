# TestApp

This app will basically be a clock that tells the current time and date. This 
uses react native and the Expo Go app on a phone. You then clone the repo inside 
the terminal and open the "TestApp" React Directory. You will first want to run 
"npm install" to download all the required files. I personally had to run this command
to get it to work (if npm install doesn't work). It just downloads it locally instead of globally: 
'npm install --save-dev @expo/ngrok' 
Once done just run the command "npx Expo Start --tunnel" and it will prompt the user to scan a QR code. 
Finally, once the user scans the QR code the app will open inside of "Expo Go".
