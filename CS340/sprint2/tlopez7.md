## Use of AI
Use of Claude AI to help with adding additional features such as the captcha systems and the customizable features such as the custom photos. I decided to use claude instead since I found it much more useful than any other AI when it came to explaining things 

## Accomplished 
For this sprint, I primarily focused on adding a security feature that the user is required to go through before getting access to the app. Once I got done with my parts, I assisted with any other part of the app that my teammates needed help with.
