## Use of AI
I use to only utilize ChatGPT, but this sprint I wanted to integrate VScode into my workflow. I use to use nvim, but now I wanted to be able to view cmd and code at the same time.
This also enabled me to use Co-Pilot, which I realized is an invaluable tool. Having all my tools in one place has become my coding more effiecent, I also really appreciate
the auto completion. So this sprint, heavy usage of Co-Pilot. 

## Accomplished 
This sprint I aimed to build upon and improve the existing framework. On the home screen I was able to integrate a "Remember Me" feature. I also had the opportunity to overhaul the 
security features. Creating a more complex and robust security system. Furthermore, for user customization I added a feature where the user can deploy a profile picture
from their gallery. This is alongside their username, pulled from the Supabase system.
