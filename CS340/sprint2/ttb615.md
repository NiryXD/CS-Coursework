### Use of AI
I primarily used ChatGPT to assist with creating the search filter and determining its implementation. I also used it to help me find out why the app wasn't working as expected. 

### What you accomplished
For this sprint, I focused mainly on the Search functionality. I added a 'Recent Searches' tab underneath the search bar, which displays the five most recently viewed recipes by the user. I also added a search filter, which allows users to only be able to view recipes within a range of calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Additionally, I adjusted the recipe details screen so that it works with dark mode and so that it works nicely with the search filter functionality.
