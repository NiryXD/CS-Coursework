Sometimes the app would not work and break in other branches that
I have worked on, but in the end I have been able to fix and push to
main without any issues. Thankfully not many problems this sprint.

## Use of AI and/or 3rd party software

I did use ChatGPT to help with aiding of how to grasp Javascript 
to save favorites with supabase. So mainly used ChatGPT to help 
start favoritesStorage.js.

## What you accomplished
I feel like I have accomplished some key implementations to the API 
functionality, like macronutrient information. Customers/clients would 
want something like this if you are tracking this type of information 
for health. Also fixed a bug in where the text was still black when you 
switched to dark mode, which caused visibility issues. Now you can see
what you type in dark mode. Lastly, I added the favorites feature because
I feel like this is necessary for the app. The client/customer would 
want to save recipes to come back to later for easier access.
