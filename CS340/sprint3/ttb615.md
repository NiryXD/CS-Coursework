### Use of AI
I used Claude AI to assist with updating the UI for the home screen and determining its implementation. I drew up a design and it was able to help me with the creation of the new home screen. I also used it to help me find out why the app wasn't working as expected. 

### What you accomplished
For this sprint, I focused mainly on the Home Screen UI. I added a 'Favorites' button and 'My Recipes' button underneath the search bar, which takes you to those respective screens. I also made sure that they properly worked with the pictures of their respective recipes and made sure they worked with dark mode.
