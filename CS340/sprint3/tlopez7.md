## Use of AI
I used Claude AI to assist me with making sure that OPENAI would be properly linked to our chatbot. It greatly helped me creating the working bot while also 
providing a good amount of feedback we will use for the next sprint.

## Accomplished 
For this sprint, I primarily worked on getting OPENAI integration set up for our app. I also went ahead and added a rating system to all of our recipies. Finally,
I added a small "recommended" recipies tab at the bottom that provides suggestions of similar recipies.
