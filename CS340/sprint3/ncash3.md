# Sprint 3

1. name: Noah Cash
1. github: ncash3
1. group: VolBites

## What you planned to do

1. [Restaurants Page](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/VolBites/issues/41)
2. [Random Recipe Generator](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/VolBites/issues/42)
3. [Geoapify API](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/VolBites/issues/40)

## What you did not do

1. Dining Hall Menu
2. Calorie tracker) 

We have basically everything done that we wanted to get done. These are just things
that I thought would be cool, but didn't do. They weren't necessary for the success of the
sprint. That is why they are not in Github.

## What problems you encountered

Not many problems this time around. It was just kind of a "everyone pitch in some features when
they come to mind" sprint. This sprint was not as structured as the first two, and thats fine because
I feel that we are in a pretty good spot. The main thing that I heard from the group that was
a problem was learning how to implement the AI and the prompts we give it. I did not work on
the AI bot, but just from what I heard, that was a problem. Also some disagreements with where
to put the random recipe button at. We decided to make it the logo on the home page.

## Issues you worked on

1. [Restaurants Page](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/VolBites/issues/41)
2. [Random Recipe Generator](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/VolBites/issues/42)
3. [Geoapify API](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/VolBites/issues/40)

## Files you worked on

1. VolBites/HomeScreen.js
2. VolBites/geoapify.js (new)
3. VolBites/RestaurantsScreen.js (new)
4. VolBites/RecipeDetailScreen.js
5. VolBites/.env
6. VolBites/App.js

## Use of AI and/or 3rd party software

Used AI (Copilot) to give free alternatives to Google Places, which costs money. Other than
that, the only thing I used it for was to give a start to how geoapify.js and 
RestaurantsScreen.js was gonna link to HomeScreen.js. 

## What you accomplished

What I feel like I accomplished was putting a stamp of completion on the project by
adding more subtle features. I will admit, the features are not too important for the
functionality of the app, but they are cool to have in my opinion. I got to use
what I learned working with the Spoonacular API to implement the Geoapify API, which 
was a nice experience to have. The Geoapify API gives places based on the location you
give it, and all I did was filter out everything other than restaurants to display on
the page. The random recipe generator is like a little easter egg, where you tap the
center logo on the home screen and it takes you to a random recipe. It adds an element
of suprise, which might be good if you do not know what to make.
