## Use of AI
I utilized Copilot integrated with VScode. I had ChatGPT help me brainstorm additions I could make, but it mainly took the back seat in this sprint. My new love, Copilot, can easily be weilded in the IDE of my choice.

## Accomplished 
This sprint I mainly worked on fleshing out the implementation of the Chatbot. So being able to direct the user to recipe pages, aswell as resturants. So for example you can ask "give me a recipe that has less that 1000 calories", and it spits one out for you. 
I also created a preferences page that tracks allergens and dietary restrictions. The Chatbot keeps these settings in mind and reccomends food that are within your scope. I also fixed darkMode in the new pages like the resturant finder or the Chatbot page.
