## Use of AI and/or 3rd party software

I used AI to help kind aid in starting with react native since it is a first
for me . I do have some experience in JavaScript, so that was not much of a 
learning curve. The tool I used was ChatGPT.

## What you accomplished

I have accomplished implementing the API of spoonacular to the app. I would say
that it all works well and it is a pretty cool tool to use. I developed the
search bar (can search items with keywords) and the instructions on how to
cook the dishes. We will continue to build and change to best fit our goals,
but I feel like my job was to get a firm foundation for using the API.
