## Use of AI
Use of ChatGPT was done to assit with making sure the project was setup correctly. 
This greatly helped as the original attempt did not go as planned, so having ChatGPT guide me was very useful.

## Accomplished
For this sprint, I focused on setting up the Supabase Database for our project. I made it so the email and password of the users are saved into it. I then focused on creating a login and signup screen that lets the user create a brand new account and use those credentials to login the next time they open the app. Finally, I assisted with creating the home screen of the actual app.
