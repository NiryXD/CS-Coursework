### Use of AI
I used mainly ChatGPT to help with the creation of UI elements, such as the Settings button, Log Out Button, and Dark Theme Slider. I also used it to help me find out why the app wasn't working as expected. 

### What you accomplished
For this sprint, I focused mainly on the Settings functionality. First, I had to make a Settings Screen. Then on that screen, I made a dark theme slider, which was mainly to keep things easy on the eyes for the user. I also Added a "Log Out" button, which would log out the user when pressed. I also helped with the implementation of the new app icon.
