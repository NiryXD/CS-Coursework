# Sprint 1

Name: Ar-Raniry Ar-Rasyid
Github ID: NiryXD
Group Name: Vol Bites

### What you planned to do

* I wanted to overhaul the UI
* I wanted to add functionality to the search bar
* I wanted to add a search history


### What you did not do

* Did not add search bar history
* Did not accomplish search bar food image page

### What problems you encountered

I had trouble with Supabase. I also had trouble with UI templates. They aren't compatible with Mobile, they're mostly for Web. So I just decided
to use the native library.

### Issues you worked on

I just overhauled the UI for the beginning stages of the projects.

### Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I used ChatGPT to show me the ropes of Javascript. I had to brainstorm what technologies I could use to style the app like Chakra UI, but decided on what was already in the react library. 

### What you accomplished
I made the app navigatible and user friendly. Before it was just raw text, now it has styling ✨
